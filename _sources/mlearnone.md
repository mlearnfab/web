This page describes the curriculum for Machine Learning, Level I. 



## <font color="maroon">Main Topics</font>

In Machine Learning, Level I we will cover four principal topics:

- *What is Machine Learning?*
- *Simple Linear Regression*
- *Multiple Linear Regression*
- *Classification with K-Nearest Neighbor*


Machine Learning, Level I will also serve as introduction to the statsmodels and scikit-lrn libraries.


## <font color="maroon">What is Machine Learning?</font>

We briefly describe the history of AI research: the key distinction is between *general* and *narrow AI*. We then define machine learning, a form of narrow AI. Machine learning and deep learning, both are subbranches of narrow AI. We sketch the basic steps of building machine learning and deep learning models. 


## <font color="maroon">Simple Linear Regression</font> 

We will begin our study of machine learning with simple linear regression (SLR). Despite its simplicity, linear regression is among the most powerful techniques in the AI practitioner's toolkit. A solid grasp of its core concepts is also essential for tackling more advanced methods such as deep learning. 



## <font color="maroon">Multiple Linear Regression</font> 

In simple linear regression our aim is to predict a single target variable from a single feature variable. In simple linear regresion, both target and feature variables are *continuous*. With multiple linear regression our aim is to increase *predictive power* by using *multiple* feature variables. 

## <font color="maroon">Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) </font>

In regression, the target variable is continuous. In classification, by contrast, the target variable is discrete. The simplest form of classification is *binary classification*, where the target variable has only two possible outcomes. We will introduce binary classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is simple to understand and easy to implement. At the same time, it's a stepping stone to more sophisticated classification algorithms and approaches in machine learning.
