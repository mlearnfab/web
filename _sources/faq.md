**Q.** *How does the community work?*

**A.** The community supports informal and formal learning paths. In the informal learning path, you are a "guest" of the @mlearnfab community. As guest, you are welcome to attend all "open" sessions and events. In the formal learning path, you become a "member" of the community by enrolling in a formal course of study. 

Members of @mlearnfab receive access to additional instructional resources, invitation to small group recitations, and the ability to access learning modules as they become available.

**Q.** *How much does it cost to join as a member of *@mlearnfab*?*

**A.** There is no cost in being a guest or a member. The fee structure might change in 2023. To remain as a membe you must show activity each week, even if the activity is minimal. Otherwise, you will lose your status as member and place in the cohort. Think of it as getting a free membership pass to a fitness club. If you don't show up regularly, you will lose your pass.

**Q.** *What learning paths are available now?*

**A.** <font color="maroon">**Machine Learning Basics**</font> begins on Feb. 28, 2022. New members can join at any time. Machine Learning Basics consists of five learning modules. The first three are available now: 

- [Python, Level I](pythonone)
- [Data Science, Level I](datascienceone)
- [Machine Learning, Level I](mlearnone)

The other two modules (Data Science, Level II; Machine Learning, Level II) will be available starting on May 1st, 2022. The entire sequence of learning paths is described in the [Learning Paths Overview](learningpaths) document.


[Python, Level I](pythonone) provides basic proficiency in Python. [Data Science, Level I](datascienceone) provides basic proficiency in data science using the *pandas*, *matplotlib*, and *seaborn* libraries. [Machine Learning, Level I](mlearnone) provides a basic introduction to regression and classification, the two primary forms of supervised machine learning. The module also serves as an introduction to the [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries.

**Q.** *What is the time commitment?*

**A.** Each module is designed so that the curriculum can be completed on average in 25 hours. Someone who spends 3-5 hours per week can expect to complete a single module in approximately 5 weeks. But you can go at your own pace and access the materials just-in-time as you need it.

---

**Q.** *Do I need to complete each module in a specific amount of time?*

**A.** No. You can go at your own pace. As mentioned above, you must show minimal activity each week.

---

**Q.** *Do I need to enroll in each of the modules separately.*

**A.** No. Enrollment in **Machine Learning Basics** learning path will give you access to all three modules and other modules as they become available. 


**Q.** *Will there be tests?*

**A.** No. But you will have many opportunities to practice with exercises, assignments, and quizzes. There are no formal grades. Your score on the "formative assessments" are meant to help you evaluate your progress.

---

**Q.** *Will I get a certificate?*

**A.** We do not issue formal certificates. However, you will receive "badges" during your journey to mark progress. 

---


**Q.** *Are the sessions recorded?*

**A.** Member sessions are recorded. Members will also be able access a catalog of learning videos as they get developed.

---


**Q.** *How is this different from other online courses?*

**A.** Learning science has established that the optimal way to learn, especially complex topics, is "active learning" and "collaborative learning" in a supportive community of fellow learners. The curriculum is being designed so that you are learning together with others. As an alumnus, you will also be developing a professional network of highly talented individuals around the globe. 

---

**Q.** *How do I enroll?*

**A.** To enroll in the formal path, go to the mlearnfab [moodle web site](https://mlfab.moodlecloud.com). Click on "Create new account" at the bottom. After you have created the new account, email mlearnfab@gmail.com. You will then receive instructions (within 24 hours) on how to get started.

**Q.** *Do I need to share my personal information?*

**A.** No. All we need is a name and an email address. If you choose to, you can remain anonymous. We won't ask you for, not expect you to disclose any PII (personally identifiable information).
