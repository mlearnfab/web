**Q.** *How does the community work?*

**A.** The community supports informal and formal learning paths. In the informal learning path, you are a "guest" and welcome to attend all "open" sessions and events. In the formal learning path, you become a "member" of the community by enrolling in one or more formal courses of study. 

Members receive access to additional instructional resources, invitation to small group recitations, and the ability to enroll in other learning modules as they become available.

**Q.** *How much does it cost to join?*

**A.** There is no cost in being a guest or a member. The fee structure might change in 2023. Because it costs money to support our activities, you must remain active in a learning path in order to retain member status.

**Q.** *What learning paths are available now?*

**A.** We are enrolling members in Python Bootcamp for Maching Learning, Level I. The Python I module provides basic proficiency in Python to move forward with other modules. Upon enrollment, you will be placed in a cohort of 15 learners. You are encouraged, though not required, to form a study group of 3-5 students.

**Q.** *What is the time commitment?*

**A.** Each module is designed so that the curriculum can be completed on average in 25 hours. Someone who spends 3-5 hours per week can expect to complete a single module, therefore, in approximately 5 weeks.

**Q.** *Do I need to complete each module in a specific amount of time?*

**A.** No. However, you must show some activity each week, even if it is minimal. Otherwise, you will lose your status in the cohort and will need to renroll.

**Q.** *How is this different from other online courses?*

**A.** Learning science has established that the optimal way to learn, especially complex topics, is "active learning" in a supportive community of fellow learners. As an alumnus, you will also be developing a professional network of highly talented individuals around the globe.

**Q.** *How do I enroll?*

**A.** To enroll in Python I, go to the mlearnfab [moodle web site](https://mlfab.moodlecloud.com). Click on "Create new account" at the bottom. After you have created the new account, email mlearnfab@gmail.com. You will then receive instructions (within 24 hours) on how to get started.
