# <font color="maroon">Python, Level I</font> 

This page describes the curriculum for Python for Machine Learning, Level I. 



## <font color="maroon">I. Units</font>

Python I is organized into 8 units.

- **Unit 0:** Overview of Programming

- **Unit 1:** Getting Started 

- **Unit 2:** Simple Data Types and Operations

- **Unit 3:** String Methods

- **Unit 4:** Collections and Operations

- **Unit 5:** Iteration

- **Unit 6:** Branching

- **Unit 7:** Functions



## <font color="maroon">II. Main Topics</font>

In Python I we will cover six mains topics.

- **Algorithms**

- **Simple Objects**

- **Collections**

- **Iteration**

- **Branching**

- **Functions**

### <font color="blue">Programs and Algorithms</font>

We can define a **program** informally as a series of instructions. A simple program might be:

- Accept two numbers as input
- Add the two numbers
- Print the result

Programs are also called **algorithms**. 

> A bit more formally, an algorithm is a finite list of instructions that describe a **computation** that when executed on a provided a set of inputs will proceed through a set of well-defined states and eventually produce an output.

### <font color="blue">Simple Objects</font>


By simple objects we mean Python's simple built-in types:

- *integers*: natural numbers such as -241 and 503005
- *floats*: decimal number such as 2.71418 and -200.53
- *booleans*: the values True and False
- *strings*: sequences of text characters

### <font color="blue">Collections</font>

In the collections section we will study:

- *lists*: lists are ordered collections. lists are mutable.
- *tuples*:  tuples are ordered collections. tuples are immutable.
- *sets*: sets are unique collection of objects. sets are mutable.
- *dictionaries*: dictionaries are unordered key value pairs. dictionaries are mutable.

### <font color="blue">Iteration</font>

Computers excel at repeating automated tasks. Iteration is the repeated execution of a set of tasks. Most computer languages have at least two types of loops:

- **for-loops** are used when a block of code needs to be executed for a known number of repetitions
- **while-loops** are suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance, but depends on a condition

### <font color="blue">Branching</font>

Most programming languages have branching: the ability to execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.

### <font color="blue">Functions</font>

Functions are the bedrock of any programming language. A function is a block of code designed to carry out a particular task. Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times and thus re-used. Functions can also be shared between different programs.
