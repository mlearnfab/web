- **Unit 0: Orientation:** In the orientation session we will go over the curriculum and expectations. 


<p>


- **Unit 1: Getting Started:** In Unit 1 we will introduce the Jupyter Notebooks environment and the tools you will be using during the course of study. 


<p>


- **Unit 2: Simple Linear Regression.** In Unit 2 we we begin our study of machine learning with simple linear regression (SLR). Despite its simplicity, linear regression is among the most powerful techniques in the AI practitioner‚Äôs toolkit. A solid grasp of its core concepts is also essential for tackling more advanced methods such as deep learning

- **Unit 3: K-Nearest Neighbors.** In Unit 3 we introduce classification as the other principal form of supervised learning. In regression, the target variable is continuous. In classification, by contrast, the target variable is discrete. The simplest form of classification is binary classification, where the target variable has only two possible outcomes.  In this unit, we investigate binary classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is simple to understand and easy to implement. At the same time, it‚Äôs a stepping stone to more sophisticated classification algorithms and approaches in machine learning.

- **Unit 4: Multiple Linear Regression.** In simple linear regression our aim was to predict a single target variable from a single feature variable. In simple linear regresion, both target and feature variables were continuous. With multiple linear regression our aim is to increase predictive power by using multiple feature variables


<p>


- **Unit 5: Model Evaluation: Regression.** In Unit 5 we discuss two principal methods for assessing regression models: MSE and ùëÖ2. 


<p>


- **Unit 6: Model Evaluation: Classification** In Unit 6 we present some key metrics for evaluating classification models.


<p>


- **Unit 7: Bias-Variance Tradeoff** In Unit 7 we delineate model development as a form of optimization: the best models strike a balance between minimizing error and maximing generalization.
